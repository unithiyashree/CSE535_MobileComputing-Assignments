CSE 535 -  Mobile Computing (Assignment I)
As mentioned in the class we have  used the codes(upload server & download server) for this application.
While working on this application we faced a lot of issues with upload and download feature, so we modified the code according to our application requirement.
Zip file consists of codes and one readme file.
In readme file we shared the drive link of all the 4 member videos(categorically by name)
Here is the drive link: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hqli4qFiW3vTE7MV3X-ToUgbAebz56i8?usp=sharing

To run the application, open the downloaded zip file in android studio.
